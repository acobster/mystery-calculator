# The Mystery Calculator

The Mystery Calculator is a groovy little number trick that usually comes in the form of a small physical booklet with six pages.

It's actually quite a neat little bit of math, so I decided to implement it as a small React site, partly to make something cool and educational, partly to teach myself React.
